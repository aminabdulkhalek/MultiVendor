Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Angular Frame Work](https://angular.io/). Angular is a TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
